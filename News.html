                        June 14, SM Entertainment denied rumors regarding aespa’s upcoming release.<br><br>

                        Recently, an audio clip spread on online communities with the claim that it is an English demo of aespa’s 
                        new song “Girls.” The posts also added that producer Yoo Young Jin participated in making 
                        the song. <span id = "dots">...</span> <span class = "more" id = "more"><br><br>
                        
                        In response to this, a representative of SM Entertainment commented, “The relevant demo is 
                        not aespa’s new song.” <br><br>
                        
                        aespa made their debut in November 2020 with “Black Mamba,” and they followed up with the hit tracks 
                        “Next Level” and “Savage.” Earlier this month, aespa confirmed their comeback with their second mini 
                        album “Girls.” The album already surpassed 1 million stock pre-orders,
                        setting a new personal best for the girl group.<br><br>
                        
                        Before aespa’s second mini album “Girls” drops on July 8, the group will be pre-releasing their 
                        English-language single “Life’s Too Short” on June 24.

                                “Up Next” artist for June, making aespa only the second Asian artist after NCT 127

                    On June 3, they took to their official Instagram account to speak about the<span id = "dots2">...</span>

                        “Giselle, who has always been very interested in the issue of abandoned animals, said that

                        sending such a large amount of donation!”<br><br>

                        Aug. 6 and 7 at the Pia Arena MM in Yokohama, Japan. <br> <br>

                        Aespa will be dropping their second mini-album “Girls” on July 8. Ahead of 
                        the album’s release, Aespa will release the English single “Life’s Too Short” on June 24. <br><br>

                        Last month, Time magazine included Aespa, composed of Giselle, Karina, Ningning,
                        and Winter, as one of its 2022 Next Generation Leaders, which showcased 
                        “young people from across fields and around the globe who are working to build a better world.” <br><br>

                        Besides Aespa, those in the list were Olga Rudenko, Ukraine; Maximilian Davis, United Kingdom; 
                        Jonathan Bailey, United Kingdom; Deepica Mutyala, United States; CKay, Nigeria; Jaz Brisack,

                        In April, Aespa made their debut US live performance at the 
                        Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California.<br><br>

                        “This is actually our very first time performing in such…in front of such a 
                        large audience and we are so happy to be here and we are ready to party,” Giselle told the audience.

                            In a video released online, BoA is seen making a colorist joke on Girls’ Generation’s Hyoyeon’s past

                            It seems like some K-pop idols just don’t understand the term ‘watch and learn’ as more artists from 
                            SM Entertainment are called out for their insensitive remarks about dark skin color. First, 
                            it was Aespa's (Stylized as aespa) Giselle who was slammed by fans for her lip-syncing 
                            the N-word on purpose and now it is Karina, another member of aespa, who is being called out by 
                            fans for her insensitive reaction to colorist remarks alongside mature idols like BoA and Hyoyeon. 
                            The newest girl group project from the label titled, Girls On Top (also known as GOT, in short) comprising 
                            of famous female idols from SM Entertainment is now facing heavy backlash online after member BoA’s 
                            colorist remark and aespa’s Karina’s overly exaggerated reaction to it.<br><br>
                            
                            With SM Entertainment launching their first female supergroup composed of other idols from the label, 
                            Girls On Top’s first subunit named GOT the beat consisting of members namely BoA, Taeyeon and 
                            Hyoyeon of Girls’ Generation, Seulgi and Wendy of Red Velvet, and Karina and Winter of aespa 
                            that dropped their first single, ‘Step Back’ early in January this year and are currently promoting 
                            the same. Just as they do so, members BoA, Hyoyeon, and Karina have now found themselves in some 
                            hot water with K-pop fans who are calling out their colorist remarks on Twitter.<br> <br>
