                            NAVIS, also stylized as nævis, (Hangul: 나이비스, naibiseu) is an AI system that helps the avatars of aespa appear in the real world, allowing them to be seen by the real aespa members. She was first revealed in the MY, KARINA teaser video. She was also featured in the group's Black Mamba promotional images.
                        <br><br>
                            Based on the music video and lyrics of "Savage", it is believed that Navis sacrificed herself to help aespa defeat Black Mamba. If she can be resurrected, they might meet again.
