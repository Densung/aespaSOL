                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &#8269; Ningning: "Is she an eonni?" <br>
                            &#8269; She loves watching action movies, war movies, and movies that are hard to understand. <br>
                            &#8269; When she was younger she wanted to be a singer. She also wanted to be a soldier because 
                                    she thought that was very attractive, and the fact that she comes from a family where many 
                                    members that were/are soldiers.<br>
                            &#8269; Her favorite ride at the amusement park are the rollercoasters. Ningning is her 
                                    rollercoaster partner. <br>
                            &#8269; She is the only member where the ae-version of herself has the same hair color as her debut 
                                    colour (bleach blond).<br>
                            &#8269; She was the first member to be revealed. <br>
                            &#8269; She was casted by SM Entertainment during a dance festival in her hometown, Yangsan-si (Yangsan City). <br>
                            &#8269; She uses the iPhone 11 yellow. <br>
                            &#8269; She is allergic to kiwifruit and tomatoes. <br>
                            &#8269; Her stage name "Winter" was chosen out of several different candidates. Others included Millie, 
                                    영원히/Young Won (forever), 모아/Moa (to collect)[8] Another was Baekseul (Snow White) because 
                                    of her fair skin.<br>
                            &#8269; As she is born in January 1, under the rules of Korean Age, she never adds a second year on her age, 
                                    because that second age is for people that haven't celebrated their birthday in the new year. 
                                    All people start their lives at 1-year-old.<br>
                            &#8269; According to Ningning, Winter is the best at filleting fish. <br>
                            &#8269; She appears in Kangta's music video "Free To Fly 2021" with NCT's Sungchan. <br>
                            &#8269; She can imitate sound effects from Kakao Talk. <br>
                            &#8269; She can turn the hands 360 degrees and flip the hands from palm up to palm down outwards, 
                                    and can make a loud click from her tongue rolled backwards.<br>
                            &#8269; Her Busan accent has weakened over time as a trainee, but retained the tonality of the accent.<br>
                            &#8269; She is an avid dreamer, so much so that her parents often brush her off when she conveys messages 
                                    from her late grandfather.<br>
                            &#8269; When she first heard an Aespa song in a taxi, the taxi driver actually skipped their song because it's 
                                    too energetic for him.<br>
                            &#8269; She revealed her MBTI is ISTP, and is the only member whose MBTI start with I.<br>
                            &#8269; She likes to sit with her feet on the chair, then tuck her arms around her legs.<br>
                            &#8269; Her nickname in high school used to be "Kim Min Kyung Hoon" (shown above) due to the fact that 
                            she looked like Buzz singer Min Kyung Hoon.<br>
