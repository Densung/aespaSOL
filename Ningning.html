                        &#8269; If she had to describe herself with one word it would be sexy. <br>
                        &#8269; Her childhood dream was to become a prince because they ride on horses and they are respected. <br>
                        &#8269; She can play the piano. <br>
                        &#8269; She is an only child. <br>
                        &#8269; She was the third member to be revealed. <br>
                        &#8269; She is the only SM Rookie to debut in the group, while other members were trainees. <br>
                        &#8269; She is the only female SM Rookie that debuted under SM Entertainment after the debut of Red Velvet. <br>

                        &#8269; Her English name is Vivian. <br>
                        &#8269; In 2021, she became the first member to dye her hair red for Next Level promotions. <br>
                        &#8269; She has the longest trainee period of all members, so others initially greeted her in 
                                honorifics. Ningning, in turn, wasn't good at greeting or distinguishing between honorifics 
                                and plain speech, so she accidentally greeted Giselle and Winter in plain speech.<br>
                        &#8269; She can do a split from having one foot already on a small table. <br>
                        &#8269; She dislikes ASMR. <br>
                        &#8269; She also feels uncomfortable borrowing clothes from others. Because she is 
                                the clumsiest member and spilling drinks, she often stains them.<br>
                        &#8269; She also loses items many times, to the point that she'd imnediately buy a set 
                                of replacements, even when the orginal items are founds within the day.<br>
                        &#8269; She can make faces without laughing. She once did that in their appearance in 
                                Choi Hwa Jung's Power Time, where she made a face during break time before she saw a 
                                camera making her embarrassed.<br>
